# Workforce-AI-Adoption-Productivity-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes how different departments in an organization are adopting and benefiting from AI. The goal is to understand AI usage levels, employee's mindset toward AI, and its impact on productivity.  I use libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
