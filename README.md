# Workforce-AI-Adoption-Productivity-Analysis-Project
## Project Overview:
This project analyzes how different departments in an organization are adopting and benefiting from AI. The goal is to understand AI usage levels, employee's mindset toward AI, and its impact on productivity.  I use libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
## Objective:
The goal of this project is to:
Develop a data-driven analytics framework that quantifies AI adoption, measures productivity uplift, calculates ROI, and provides actionable insights for strategic workforce planning and AI deployment.
## Problem Statement:
1-	Analyze who is using AI effectively and in which department
2-	How AI Adoption influence productivity task efficiency, overtime cost.
3-	What is the return of investment (ROI) of AI tools per employee or Department?
4-	Which workforce segments resist AI Adoption and how does this effect overall performance.
5-	Is overtime reduce or not after using AI Tools or AI Training. 
## Key Findings and Insights:
- Employees across all departments are using AI, but high-level remains the lowest everywhere, AI adoption is high in R&D and sales department but also very low than high, signaling a strong need for capability-building.
      - According to Job roles AI usage level is very low, Maximum Job roles AI usage level is Medium and low. Sales Executive, Research Scientist, Manufacturing Director and Lab technician are lowest AI usage Job roles. 
- Maximum employees are using AI Tools, its 78%. 
- Productivity increasing level is also improving after using AI Tools.
- Working Hours reduced after using AI tools, Maximum employees(Count- 832) are not doing overtime after using AI Tools, but 318 employees using AI tools and also doing overtime, They should have proper AI training and skills. 
- Large number of employees received 50+ Hours of AI training but productivity gain percent in 0%.
- Productivity increase after using AI Tools but it’s not very high many employees productivity is also low.
- Some Job roles are highly resist AI, Sales Executive, Research scientist, Lab technician, Manufacturing director these job roles are highly resist AI.
- AI resistant Job roles employee’s productivity gain is very low, there 0% productivity count is very high. 
- AI Resistant employees count are very small according to this count productivity is also very low. AI adoption supportive employee’s productivity is very high. If we want to increase our productivity we need to support AI Adoption.                            
- R&D is already moving toward AI rapidly, Sales can become strong supportive but need improvement. But HR Department holds the key- they are showing high Natural Sentiment. They have to more AI training to boost productivity and AI Adoption further. 
##  Recommendations:
-	According to this insights employee’s need to adopt and support AI for improving their productivity.
-	Employees need training according to their Job roles and Hands-on real workflow based training 
-	Provide post training support, Always measure AI usage level after training.
-	Need feedback mechanism, ask to employees which type of help they need. 
-	If we want to increase our Productivity we need to support AI Adoption Properly.
-	They have to need more effective AI training to boost productivity and AI Adoption further. 
## Conclusion:
      AI adoption is still at a basic level across departments and Job roles, and many employees remain hesitant. By increasing targeted training and improving AI awareness, if we do all things properly and delicately we unlock the full benefit of AI technology.
